The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. For each record it is provided:
======================================

- Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration.
- Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope. 
- A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables. 
- Its activity label. 
- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.

Two sets of data were there - test & training . The data sets were combined in final data set

Total 561 variables were calculated from various features. Further mean, std, max, min were part of these features. (A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables). We segregated mean & std variables. For these there were 79 variables. For each group of Subject & Activity we found the mean for these vriables.
Total no of volunteers - 30
Various activities - 6
For final data set we have - 
Total rows 30 * 6  = 180. Total columns 79 + 2 = 81
Total obervations 180*81 = 14580


Total 81 Columns

1 - Subject - On whome experiment was done (total 30 Volunteers)

2 - Activity - THe activity done by Voulunteers (Total 6 types of activities)
